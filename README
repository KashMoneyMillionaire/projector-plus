This repo is to create Chrome/Edge (maybe more browsers in the future) extensions to enhance the Projector experience.

# Installation (on Chrome (and probably Edge))

1. Download the zipped extension [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KashMoneyMillionaire/projector-plus/main/projector-plus.zip)
   a. Sometimes that zip doesn't work for Mac. Instead, download the directory zip, then unzip that to get the embedded zip
	
2. Unzip `projector-plus.zip` 
	
3. Follow instructions to install it [from Google](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2714278?hl=en#:~:text=Go%20to%20chrome%3A%2F%2Fextensions,the%20app%20or%20extension%20folder.)
	
4. Navigate to https://app.projectorpsa.com/timeoff
	
5. Verify your balance is correct. The "Balance" column and "PTO" row should now have "Current" and "EOY".
	
6. (Optional) Let me know if there are any bugs.
